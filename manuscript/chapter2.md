# Jamie

Jamie tapped the photograph on the mantle as she passed by, a silent thanks to the previous owners. They certainly looked like nice people. Probably elderly, because that mustache had one out of style two decades before. No kids, but it looked like they had certainly loved their cats. The cats, of course, were long gone. But their beds and scratching posts and cat nip were still strewn about the living area as if they had just left moments before. It was always a little freaky to think about what had been.

She padlocked the door and went to the kitchen. She was ravenous. She hadn't eaten since yesterday morning and had probably burned a lot of energy bleeding and what not. To top it all off, she hadn't even found the ammo that she was looking for. It was harder and harder to come by, and her gun was empty, and therefore, useless. A crowbar was all that stood between her and the threatening oblivion of death.  

The can of beans cracked open under her knife's pressure. She carefully poured the liquid off into the rusted sink and dipped her fingers into the mixture. Well past their expiration date, the beans were slimier than they used to be, but as far as she was concerned, it was food, and it was all she had. 

The door knocker banged as Jamie desperately fingered the rest of her food into her mouth. Her heart rate skyrocketed. Who knew she was here? Why were they knocking? The cool metal of her rusted crowbar was little reassurance as she stalked slowly towards the door. The knocker banged again.

"Please! Let me in! The sun is going down and I have nowhere else to go." The male voice was high pitched in terror. "I know you're in there. I watched you come home." The voice seemed almost sheepish in that admission. "I don't want trouble. I've got food! Candles!" 

She crept closed to the door. Food and candles? That was certainly a start. She wondered what else he had to offer. She caressed the dead bolt, contemplating the stranger outside. If he had wanted trouble, he certainly would've just broken the window. Although that would ruin the shelter for him, so perhaps not. But he sounded amiable enough, and she had a crowbar. Crowbars do wonders for jerks and thieves. 

“Come on!” The guy was still blabbering. “I’ll throw my weapons down, I swear! I don’t want to hurt you, I just don’t want to be one of them.” She heard a clatter and through the curtained window, she could see him waving his arms all around him. She spotted a scruffy, angular face through the curtains. He did look like he could be telling the truth. And she hadn’t had any fellow human companionship in... lord, how long had it been? 



She made her choice, unlocking the door and brandishing her crowbar over her shoulder. She twisted the doorknob, prayed she wouldn’t regret it, and greeted her new guest with a glower.

“Keep your hands to yourself and there won’t be any trouble.” She pulled the door open and pointed with her free hand. “You sleep on the couch.”

He looked momentarily disappointed, then rebounded from his gloom with a dashing smile and a small bow. “Sure thing.” He stepped through the threshold. His muddy boots were well worn, and his tattered shirt had dark stains, which could’ve been blood, sweat, or even food. It might’ve been white back in the day, but it had long since faded to a yellowish glow. He looked a bit like a sick leopard, except that his skin was dark. Darker than she had realized. 

Even through the filth, he was attractive. “There’s a creek out back where you can wash, if you’ve got time.”

“The black doesn’t come off.” He grinned at her, but she didn’t smile back.

“I wasn’t talking about your skin. I was talking about your smell.”

He smiled wearily at her, shrugging. "Pretty sure we all smell nowadays."

“Go wash that stench off before you stink up my whole house. The back door is right through there.” She pointed at the kitchen. 

Figuring a lost cause, he shouldered his bag and made strides towards the kitchen, but she called after him.

“Wait. Leave your bag.” His eyes met hers, a glimmer of suspicion rising through the charm. “I want to make sure that you meant what you said. Food. Candles. I won’t take anything.” She was speaking matter-of-factly, holding her wavering free hand out to his bag. She wasn’t used to people, it had been a long time. “I just want to make sure you’re not going to rape and kill me.”

“With what, exactly?” He asked as he slipped the pack off his shoulder and handed it to her. “My weapons are outside.”

“I don’t know that.” She accepted the bag. It was disappointingly light. “You could have a gun. Or a knife.”

“And you think I’d leave them in the bag?” His harsh laugh echoed in the room. “Well, I don’t. And I didn’t. But feel free to look.” 

He winked and made his exit, books squeaking on the dirtied linoleum of the kitchen floor. 

The bag had granola bars, some candles that had been pilfered from a Catholic church — she could smell the church — a few cracked and faded photos, and a flashlight with no batteries. The back door clattered as she was stuffing things back into his bag. She looked up to watch him as he turned and bolted the door. Satisfied, she turned back to her task. He took a seat in the dusty, broken recliner in the corner. 

“Are there any clothes here?” He asked. “I lost my jacket a few days ago, and haven’t found one yet to replace it.”

“You can check the master bedroom upstairs. A teenager lived her, and I’ve been using his clothes.” She fingered her own jacket. “The master bedroom might have some stuff to fit. You could also try that closet.” Jamie pointed towards the closet nestled behind the door. “Though when I looked through there, all I found was *her* clothing.” 

“Thanks.” He swung up from the recliner and strode towards the closet. The handle joggled as he pulled the door open. Almost immediately, he grabbed a red felt jacket with gold buttons and swung it over his shoulders with a flourish. He wiggled his eyebrows at her. “How do I look?”

“Gorgeous.” She replied curtly, zipping his bag shut and tossing it on the coffee table ahead of her. Silence floated between them. “What’s your name, anyway?”

“Ace.” He responded with a wiggle of his hips. The red jacket fluttered around him. He dropped it a little lower to see if he could squeeze his big man arms through the tiny, woman shaped sleeves. It was a tight fit. “My name is Ace.” His face fell steadily as he realized that the red coat would not work for him. He wiggled out of it and hung it carefully back on its hanger. 

“Interesting.” She knew it was probably not his real name. “Her winter coat might be a little more forgiving. If you insist on wearing her clothes.”

“Well, she’s certainly not using them.” He pulled the fluffy down jacket off of its hook. The arms were much larger, laced with pink and white. The colors. bright from disuse, seemed almost comical in the gray light of the house. Everything outside seemed weathered, dull. But not this jacket! It’s pink was a giant middle finger to the cruel, harsh world that awaited them outside.

“Do I look dashing?” He asked as he buttoned up. 

“You certainly look interesting.” She couldn’t help it. She cracked a smile. “Do you remember the Michelin man? The cartoon man made of marshmallows?”

His look soured a bit as he nodded. “You look a bit like that.” She finished. She offered an apology for his downtrodden look. “It’s a very puffy jacket.”

“Feels kind of flimsy, too. I bet it’ll last a week.” He looked down each of his sides, trying to examine himself. He shrugged. “Better than nothing."
