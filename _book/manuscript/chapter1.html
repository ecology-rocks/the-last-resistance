<p>Morgan awoke in a groggy, ethereal state. The darkened room swam before her eyes before slowly clearing. A lone candle burned nearly to a nub illuminated the smooth and faded wood surrounding her. She shook her head to clear the grog and sat up. Pain rocketed through her side and the night before came back to her. </p>
<p>The walkers. They were roving and for some stupid, silly reason, she had not heard their footsteps until they were far too close. Until they smelled her alluring scent of fresh, live, blood. But she felt their growls, as they had surrounded her. And she felt the air fly by as their claws inched dangerously close her face with each slash. </p>
<p>She eased her body up more, breathing shallow and praying that the damage wasn&apos;t too bad. She had no idea. Her refuge had been a miracle, of sorts. Unexpected. But where she was -- what time it was? She had no clue. She was alive. That was a start. </p>
<p>She had burned down her last candle, though. That annoyed her. She gingerly grabbed the nub and brought it closer to her abdomen. The flickering light showed nothing of her wound. Angry, she snuffed the useless nub out. She set it next to her and began the painstaking process of standing. </p>
<p>&quot;If I&apos;m not dead yet...&quot; She muttered, taking a slightly deeper breath and gritting her teeth as she pulled herself up by the metal rungs above her. She grunted as her legs finally fell into place underneath and she pushed her way up to a standing position.</p>
<p>&quot;Fuck, it hurts.&quot; She groaned as lightning raced through her left side. What had they done to her? Was she infected? Would she even know if she was? She stumbled towards the crack of daylight shining through the end of the boxcar. She would find out soon. </p>
<p>The day was cool and overcast, but still bright enough to leave her eyes watering. As they cleared, she saw the damage. Blood had crawled its way up her side to coat her armpit. It was black and crusted. She had guessed at its state by the way the fabric had pulled and stretched her side, amplifying the pain. But she had to see. </p>
<p>She grabbed the cloth where it met her pants and yanked it gently from the waistline. She pulled higher and higher until she felt the tingle. That burning agony was near. Taking her deepest breath yet, she hastily ripped the cotton-polyester blend from her freshly closed wound. The pain was blinding. </p>
<p>&quot;Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, FUCK!&quot; She shouted to no one in particular. Her eyes watered. Her brow dripped sweat. Gathering her strength together, she pulled the shirt the rest of the way overhead, and stood triumphantly topless in the cool morning air. </p>
<p>Goosebumps crawled her flesh and she looked down. The gash extended from her belly button diagonally up to her ribs. Or rather, it started in her ribs and finished just a scratch at her belly button. But the ribs part? That was deep. And bleeding. </p>
<p>Puncture? Must&apos;ve been a claw. At least it wasn&apos;t the teeth. It was the saliva that could turn you. Everyone knew that. She rolled the stiff and bloodied shirt and tied it as best she could around her pulsing, oozing ribs. It would stop soon enough. She was outright shivering now, her flesh exposed to the devilish wind. It smelled like rot and death -- but then again, it always did. </p>
<p>She shoved the nubbed candle deep into her bag, donned her tattered camo jacket, and began the long walk home. </p>
