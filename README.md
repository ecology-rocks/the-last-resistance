# The Last Resistance

Six months ago, the dead rose up. When a stranger walks into town, Jamie faces some hard choices: will she let him into her hardened heart? Or will fate tear them apart?

This was a world-building attempt in 2014. It has promise, I think -- but literally no story. Feel free to run with it. I welcome any and all pull requests!

I think this was also an attempt to build distinct characters. I don't think it worked well. In particular, I think the first character introduced, Morgan, does not distinguish well from Jamie other than location. Especially because as this was written, there are three "chapters" and 2 of them are Jamie/Ace focused. Perhaps we should either move into another story, move back to Morgan, or place Morgan elsewhere (if we're going for multiple characters) in the story structure.
